This indicates that the liver is within the normal range and does not show any signs of enlargement.\n\nSpleen Volume:\nThe patient's spleen volume is calculated to be 102.69 cm3. This falls within the normal range and does not indicate any enlargement or abnormalities.\n\nLiver/Spleen Attenuation Ratio:\nThe liver/spleen attenuation ratio is calculated to be 1.10. This ratio is above 1, indicating that there is no excess fat in the liver. Therefore, the patient does not show any signs of fatty liver diseases like NAFLD or NASH.\n\nLesions:\nMultiple lesions were detected in the liver. The largest lesion has a major axis of 54.75 mm, a minor axis of 39.25 mm, and a volume of 21.13 cm3. The other lesions have smaller dimensions and volumes. These lesions should be further evaluated to determine their nature and whether they are benign or malignant.\n\nLobes:\nThe liver is divided into nine lobes, and the volume of each lobe has been calculated. The volumes range from 8.07 cm3 to 120.09 cm3. The lobe/spleen attenuation ratios range from 1.01 to 1.14, indicating that there is no excess fat in any of the lobes.\n\nLSVR Metric:\nThe LSVR metric is calculated to be 0.30. This value is higher than the threshold of 0.24, indicating that there is a change in the shape of the liver. This could be an indication of liver cirrhosis.\n\nOverall Diagnosis:\nBased on the calculations and guidelines, the patient's liver and spleen show no signs of enlargement. The liver/spleen attenuation ratio suggests a healthy liver without excess fat. However, the presence of multiple lesions in the liver requires further investigation to determine their nature. The LSVR metric indicates a change in the shape of the liver, which could be indicative of liver cirrhosis. \n\nFurther diagnostic tests, such as a biopsy or additional imaging studies, are recommended to accurately diagnose the patient's condition and develop an appropriate treatment plan."}
