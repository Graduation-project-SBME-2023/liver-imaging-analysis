The text will contain important calculations described below like liver volume volume in cm3 , spleen volume in cm3 , lesions volume in cm3 and dimensions mm, lobes volume in cm3 and attenuation ratio with spleen. and LSVR metric which is designed to measure the change of shape of liver. Also some diagnosis guidelines will be provided below to help .\n\nGuidelines:-\n-If Liver volume is larger than 1671 this is an indication for liver enlargement\n-If Spleen volume is larger than 300 this is an indication for spleen enlargement and cirhosis\n-If Liver/Spleen attenuation ratio is less than 1, this is an indication for fatty liver diseases like NAFLD or NASH.\n-If the lesions diameter is largen than 10 or and volume are large, this is an indication for malignant tumor.\n-If the Lobe/Spleen attenuation is less than 1, this is an indication for excess fat in the lobe.\n-If the LSVR metric is higher than 0.24, this is an indication for Liver Cirrhosis.\n\nYou must follow the following instructions in the report\nInstructions:-\n-You shouldn't stick to these guidelines only, make more diagnosis beyond these guidelines to cover everything.\n-Don't mention a lot of numbers in the report, focus more on giving an overview of the patient status and making diagnosis, and decisions about the patient health conditions.\n-Analyze carefully the calculations and make an expert diagnosis and generate expert detailed report\n-The report size shouldn't exceed 500 words\n\nNote that the calculations will be delimited by four hashtags, i.e ####.", "message": "I will provide the patient calculation, analyze them carefully and diagnose the patient. \nMake sure you follow the instructions well and make an accurate diagnosis, don't mention a lot of numbers in the report\n\nCalculations : {calculations}\n\nPatient Report : "}
